## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** should be installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git** should be installed. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Virtual Environment** (Recommended): You should use `venv` or `virtualenv` to create an isolated environment for this project.

### 1. Clone the Repository
--git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-opportunity-platform.git
cd job-opportunity-platform

2. Set Up Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).

For Windows:
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate

For MacOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate


3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your secret key and other necessary environment variables.
Example .env file:


SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost, 127.0.0.1
Note: Ensure you generate a strong secret key for Django. You can generate a new secret key by running:
python

from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
print(get_random_secret_key())

5. Apply Database Migrations
Before running the server, apply the initial database migrations:
python manage.py migrate


6. Create a Superuser (Admin Account)
Create an admin user for accessing the Django admin interface:
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create a username, email, and password.

7. Run the Server
Once the environment is set up, you can run the development server:
python manage.py runserver
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to access the application.
